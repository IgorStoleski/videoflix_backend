    Parameters:
    source (str): The file path of the source video to be converted.
    video_id (str): A unique identifier for the video, used in subsequent processing.
    The conversion process involves the following steps:
    1. Generating a new filename for the 360p video by appending '_360p.mp4' to the original filename.
    2. Constructing and running an ffmpeg command to convert the video resolution to 640x360, encode video using libx264,
